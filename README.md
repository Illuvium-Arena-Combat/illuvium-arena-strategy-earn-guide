## 🌠 What is Illuvium?

Illuvium is a AAA auto-battler and open-world exploration game built on the Ethereum blockchain and powered by Immutable X. Players capture creatures called Illuvials, build battle decks, and earn ILV rewards through PvP, resource farming, and land ownership.

The ecosystem includes:

- Illuvium: Overworld – Explore and capture Illuvials
- Illuvium: Arena – Compete in tactical auto-battles
- Illuvium: Zero – Farm and extract resources from your own land

---

## 🧠 What’s Inside This Guide

- ✅ How to capture Illuvials in the Overworld
- ✅ Arena battle team comps, synergies & positioning
- ✅ Land & fuel economy tips (Illuvium Zero)
- ✅ ILV & sILV earning strategies
- ✅ Best augments, synergies, classes and affinities
- ✅ Bonus: Auto-chess tactics and energy routing tricks

---

## 🧩 Core Mechanics Breakdown

- 🧬 Illuvials: Each creature has a class (Fighter, Rogue, Psion...) & affinity (Fire, Water, Nature...)
- 🗺️ Overworld: Navigate open regions, mine resources, scan zones & battle wild Illuvials
- 🧪 Shards: Used to capture weakened Illuvials
- ⚔️ Arena: Tactical, wave-based or PvP battles using squad composition
- 💠 ILV token: Governance & reward token (also sILV for in-game use)
- 🌐 Zero: Base-building game to produce fuel & earn yield from owned LAND

---

## 🎯 Hidden Strategies & Game Tips

- 🧠 Use synergies: combining same class + affinity boosts your team’s power
- 🧲 Target high-tier Illuvials in deep zones (risk-reward system)
- 🔋 Manage energy — movement & scans consume fuel (buy from Zero or PvE)
- 📦 Shard quality matters: better shards = higher capture success
- 🧱 Use terrain & enemy positioning in Arena to outmaneuver foes
- 🪙 Convert fuel from Illuvium: Zero into tradable tokens on IMX
